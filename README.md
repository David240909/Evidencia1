In this case, since it is a project that requires managing different internal processes and users, the best option would be an agile methodology (Scrum).

Justification:

Quick iterations: You can launch small features quickly, receive feedback from the client, and make adjustments as needed.
Flexibility: It allows adaptation to changes in requirements as the project progresses.
Role management: With Scrum, you can manage development tasks according to different roles (sales, purchasing, warehouse, etc.).
The diagrams are in the repository files, but I'll send a document with the images too, just in case.

Reflection:

Challenge: Integrating image uploads was complex because it needed to be restricted to specific roles, but I was able to solve this by using role-based control in the backend.
Future improvement: If I had more time, I would implement better validation on the frontend to prevent user errors when entering data.
